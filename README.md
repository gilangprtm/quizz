# Quizz

Self-hosted real-time multiplayer quiz platform. Players join with a 6-digit PIN from any device — no app, no account.

## Deploy

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lawndlwd/quizz/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lawndlwd/quizz/main/Caddyfile
```

Create a `.env` file (see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all options):

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
JWT_SECRET=   # openssl rand -hex 32 — min 32 chars, required

# Optional
ALLOWED_DOMAIN=          # e.g. mycompany.com — restrict user sign-ups
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=     # stock photos in Quiz Studio media picker
GIPHY_API_KEY=           # GIFs in Quiz Studio media picker
# DOMAIN=quiz.example.com  # Docker/Caddy — automatic HTTPS
```

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env, then:
docker compose up -d
```

- Player join: `http://your-server/play`
- Admin panel: `http://your-server/admin`

The Docker image is pulled automatically from `ghcr.io/lawndlwd/quizz:latest`.

## Question types

| Type | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Single choice** | One correct option out of several. The only type that supports the 50/50 joker. |
| **Multiple answers** | Several correct options — the player must select exactly the right set. |
| **True / False** | Two fixed options. |
| **Open text** | Free text input, matched case- and whitespace-insensitively. |
| **Closest to** | Numeric guess on a slider within a configured range. Exact match scores full points; otherwise partial credit by distance. |
| **Fill in the blank** | Question text with `___` markers; each blank accepts one or more answers. Partial credit per blank matched. |
| **Ordering** | Arrange items in the correct order (items are shuffled per question). Partial credit per item in the right place. |
| **Locate on map** | Drop a pin on a map. Within 50 km counts as correct; beyond that, points decay exponentially with distance. |

Each question can also have:

- **Base score** and **time limit** (defaults: 500 pts, 20 s)
- **Image**, or **YouTube audio/video** with a start offset (`?t=SECONDS`) — audio plays hidden for music rounds
- **Markdown code blocks** in the question text (great for programming quizzes)
- **Image URLs as answer options** (mixable with text)
- **Explanation** shown after the reveal
- **Tags** (topic, difficulty) aggregated into the lobby intro screen

## Generate quizzes with AI

You can use **any AI you like** — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, a local model (Ollama), etc. — to turn a document into a full quiz. No API key or integration is built into Quizz; you bring your own AI and paste the result.

### How it works

1. In the admin panel, open **Create Quiz** and switch to **Paste JSON**.
2. Click **Copy prompt** (instructions + JSON schema) — or **Copy example** for a full sample quiz JSON. Paste into your AI chat and attach a document or describe a topic (source material is optional).
3. Copy the AI's JSON output, paste it into **Create Quiz → Paste JSON**, click **Apply to studio** to edit as slides (or save directly), then create the quiz from the studio when ready.

The visual editor (**Quiz Studio**) is still there for manual tweaks after import.

### Tips

- **Any document works** — PDF, Word, slides, web pages, plain text. If upload isn't supported, copy-paste the text instead.
- **Split large docs** — ask for "10 questions on chapter 3" rather than an entire textbook at once.
- **Review before hosting** — AI can misread facts or pick wrong answers; spot-check questions, especially for exams or compliance training.
- **Scanned PDFs** need OCR first (e.g. Google Drive upload, or paste text from another tool).

## Scoring

- **Base score** — configurable per question (default 500 pts) for a correct answer
- **Speed bonus** — order-based: the first correct answer gets +200, decaying linearly down to +10 for the last
- **Streak bonus** — from the 3rd consecutive correct answer, +50 pts per extra streak level
- **Partial credit** — closest-to, fill-blank, ordering, and map questions award a fraction of the base score; speed/streak bonuses only apply to fully correct answers
- The host can remove a player's points for a specific question during the game

All values (base score, bonus ranges, streak rules) are editable in the admin settings.

## Running a game

1. **Create a quiz** — build it in the editor, or use your favorite AI with the JSON import template to generate questions from a document (see [Generate quizzes with AI](#generate-quizzes-with-ai))
2. **Start a session** — a unique 6-digit PIN is generated; players join from their phones
3. **Lobby** — players appear live; a pre-game modal lets you enable jokers and tweak streak scoring for this game only
4. **Play** — server-side timer per question; auto-reveals when time runs out or everyone answered. The host can finish a question early, skip to the next, or end the game, and gets a private preview of the upcoming question
5. **Reveal** — correct answer, per-option vote distribution, explanation, and (optionally) the live leaderboard between questions
6. **Podium** — confetti finale; optionally a spinner picks a random player as the next quiz maker

Auto-advance between questions is configurable (default: manual).

### Jokers (opt-in per game, once each per player)

- **Pass** — skip a question and still earn a configured score
- **50/50** — eliminate two wrong options (single choice only)

### Players

- Join with PIN + username + avatar
- Live answered-count while waiting; score, streak, and rank after each question
- **Reconnect-safe** — reloading the page or switching tabs restores the game state, even across a server restart

## Admin & accounts

- **Two roles** — super admin and regular users; users only see and host their own quizzes
- **User management** (super admin) — list users, ban/unban, reset passwords, delete
- **Registration** can be restricted to a configured email domain
- **Session history** — past games with per-player answers, force-end running sessions
- **Settings UI** — app name/subtitle, timing, scoring, leaderboard visibility, max players (default 300), auto-advance
- **Avatar packs** — bulk-upload avatar images for players to pick from

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 20+, pnpm

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # set JWT_SECRET (and optional media keys)
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

- App: http://localhost:5173
- Admin: http://localhost:5173/admin (default: `admin` / `admin`)

## Load testing

Manual only — not run in CI. Use it before a big event, or after touching
`player:join`/`player:answer`/anything on the DB write path, to see how the
server actually holds up under many concurrent players.

```sh
cd server
pnpm load-test --url http://localhost:3000 \
  --email admin --password <admin password> \
  --players 100 --sessions 1 --questions 5 --time 15
```

Flags: `--players` (bots per session), `--sessions` (concurrent games),
`--questions`, `--time` (seconds/question), `--answer-delay` (max random
pre-answer delay, ms), `--metrics-interval` (ms between live metrics polls),
`--keep` (skip cleanup — leave the generated quiz/sessions in place).

It logs in as admin, creates a throwaway quiz, spins up the bots over real
socket.io connections, plays the game to completion, and prints join/answer
latency percentiles plus a peak event-loop-lag / SQLite-write-latency / memory
summary — then deletes what it created (unless `--keep`).

Live server health during a run — or anytime — is also available directly:
`GET /api/admin/metrics` (super admin token required). Returns event loop
lag, memory, a SQLite write-latency ping, connected socket count, and
active session/player counts. It's a point-in-time snapshot only — nothing
is persisted or graphed.

Numbers are hardware-specific — run it against the box you actually care
about, not a laptop, if the result needs to mean something.

## Stack

- **Frontend** — React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend** — Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Database** — SQLite
- **Proxy** — Caddy (auto HTTPS)
